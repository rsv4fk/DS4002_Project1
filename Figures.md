## Figures Table

| Figure     | Value | Summary |
|--------------|:-----:|:-----:|
| correlation | 0.818 | There is a strong, positive relationship between coverage frequency and unemployment rate. |
| correlation | -0.658 | There is a moderate, negative relationship between CPI and unemployment rate. |
| correlation | -0.179| There is a weak, negative relationship between case count and unemployment rate. |
| correlation | -0.084| There is a very weak, negative relationship between the percent change in cases and unemployment rate. |
| p-value | 1.92e-09 | Coverage frequency is a statistically significant predictor of unemployment rate at a significance level of 0.001. |
| p-value| 0.130212 | Case count is not a statistically significant predictor of unemployment rate at a significance level of 0.001. | 
| p-value | 9.80e-07 | The percentage change in cases is a statistically significant predictor of unemployment rate at a significance level of 0.001. |
| p-value | 0.876 | CPI is not a statistically significant predictor of unemployment rate at a significance level of 0.001. | 
| coefficient | 1.930e-01 | In the final model, a 1% increase in COVID news coverage will lead to a 0.193% increase in the unemployment rate, holding the percentage change in cases constant. |
| coefficient | -2.732e-05 | In the final model, a 1% increase in the percentage change in COVID cases will lead to a 0.00002732% decrease in the unemployment rate, holding the COVID news coverage constant.
| adjusted R-squared | 0.8359 | 83.59% of the variation in the unemployment rate can be explained by news coverage of COVID as well as the percent change in cases each month. |
